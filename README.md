# Mole fetch
Is a library to make background HTTP requests using ServiceWorker and the Fetch API

Mole fetch makes sure your applications sends HTTP request that are still running but can't be completed due to various reasons (e.g. flaky internet connection, browser crash). It requires support for ServiceWorker and SyncManager to function properly. 

##Installation

```
npm install --save mole-fetch
```
```
git clone https://github.com/thangman22/mole-fetch.git
```

##Usage

###HTML file
```javascript
const moleFetch = new MoleFetch()

function fetchFacebook() {
    //Call sendRequest for request HTTP
    moleFetch.sendRequest('facebook', 'http://localhost:5555/mock-api/online', false, 'GET')
}

//Register ServiceWoker
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator && 'SyncManager' in window) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register("sw.js").then((registration) => {
        console.log('ServiceWorker registration successful with scope: ', registration.scope)
    }).catch(function(err) {
        console.log('ServiceWorker registration failed: ', err)
    })
}

//Implement onResponse for receive response from ServiceWorker when site is online
moleFetch.onResponse('facebook').then((value) => {
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = value;
})

//Implement onResponse for receive response from Cache when site is offline
moleFetch.getCacheResponse('facebook',false).then((value) => {
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = value;
})
```

###ServiceWorker file
```javascript
importScripts('node_modules/localforage/dist/localforage.min.js')
importScripts('node_modules/mole-fetch/dist/mole-fetch.js')

self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  self.skipWaiting()
})

self.addEventListener('activate', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(self.clients.claim())
})

self.addEventListener('sync', (event) => {
  let moleFetch = new MoleFetch
  moleFetch.initBackgroudfetch(event)
})

```
